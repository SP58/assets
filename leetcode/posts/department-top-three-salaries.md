def top_three_salaries(
    employee: pd.DataFrame, department: pd.DataFrame
) -> pd.DataFrame:
    salary_cutoff = (
        employee.drop_duplicates(["salary", "departmentId"])
        .groupby("departmentId")["salary"]
        .nlargest(3)
        .groupby("departmentId")
        .min()
    )
    employee["Department"] = department.set_index("id")["name"][
        employee["departmentId"]
    ].values
    employee["cutoff"] = salary_cutoff[employee["departmentId"]].values
    return employee[employee["salary"] >= employee["cutoff"]].rename(
        columns={"name": "Employee", "salary": "Salary"}
    )[["Department", "Employee", "Salary"]]
